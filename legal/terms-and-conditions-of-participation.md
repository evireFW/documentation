# ▪️ Terms and Conditions of Participation

The Evire project is an ambitious and experimental endeavor aimed at advancing the field of blockchain technology through the development and deployment of specialized frameworks for AI, gaming, real-world assets (RWA) and decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN). While our team is dedicated to creating a robust and scalable platform, the project's success depends on numerous factors beyond our control, including technological developments, regulatory environments, and market dynamics.

It is important to note that the EVIRE token will not be sold through any initial coin offering (ICO), initial decentralized exchange offering (IDO) or any other form of token sale. Instead, the EVIRE token will be launched through a fair launch mechanism, with liquidity provided by the Evire team. This approach ensures that all participants have equal opportunity to acquire tokens without preferential treatment.

Purchasing EVIRE tokens does not guarantee any form of profit and carries significant risk. Potential investors should be aware that the value of EVIRE tokens can fluctuate widely and may result in substantial financial loss. Participation in the Evire project should be undertaken only after careful consideration and a thorough understanding of the associated risks.

The success and final outcome of the Evire project cannot be guaranteed. Various risks, including but not limited to technical failures, regulatory changes and market conditions, can impact the development and deployment of the Evire platform. The team behind Evire does not make any representations or warranties regarding the project's eventual success.

By participating in the Evire project or purchasing EVIRE tokens, participants agree to assume full responsibility for any potential losses or damages. The Evire team, its members and associated entities are released from any liability arising from the use, acquisition or trading of EVIRE tokens. Participants must perform their own due diligence and seek independent financial advice before engaging with the Evire project.

The Evire project is committed to adhering to all applicable laws and regulations. However, the regulatory landscape for blockchain and cryptocurrency projects is continuously evolving. Participants should be aware that changes in regulations could impact the project's operations and the value of EVIRE tokens.

We strongly encourage all participants to thoroughly research and understand the nature of the Evire project, its objectives and the risks involved. Engagement with the Evire project should be based on an informed decision, with a clear recognition of the speculative nature of blockchain investments.

By proceeding with participation in the Evire project, participants acknowledge and accept the terms outlined in this legal disclaimer, fully understanding the risks and uncertainties involved.
