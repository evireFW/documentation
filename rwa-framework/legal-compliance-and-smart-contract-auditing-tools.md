# ▪️ Legal Compliance and Smart Contract Auditing Tools

Maintaining legal compliance is crucial, especially when managing real-world assets (RWAs). Evire’s Real World Assets Framework includes a sophisticated suite of tools designed to ensure that all smart contracts associated with RWAs comply with local and international laws. This documentation details the functionalities, benefits, and operational insights of the legal compliance and smart contract auditing tools provided within Evire’s platform, aiming to aid developers in seamlessly navigating the complex legal landscape of asset management.
