# ▪️ Tokenomics

### Token Types and Utilities

Evire offers two types of tokens: the ERC20 EVIRE token on Ethereum and the native EVIRE token on the Evire mainnet. The ERC20 EVIRE token acts as an IOU token on Ethereum. Currently, the ERC20 EVIRE token is not deployed.

Token holders can swap their ERC20 tokens for native EVIRE tokens after the mainnet launch. This ERC20 token can be freely traded on popular decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and centralized exchanges (CEXs), providing liquidity and helping to bootstrap users from the Ethereum community.

The native EVIRE token, on the other hand, serves multiple roles within the Evire blockchain ecosystem. Besides its trading capabilities, the native EVIRE token is integral to various functions:

* **Staking.** Holders can delegate their tokens to trusted validators to earn passive commission income.
* **Governance.** Token holders can vote on software updates and other crucial community decisions.
* **Transaction Fees.** Used to pay for transaction fees within the network.
* **Exchange and Swap.** The token can be exchanged or swapped in the market.

### Token Distribution

The total supply of EVIRE tokens is capped at 800 million tokens, distributed as follows:

* **Fair Launch (45%):** 360 million tokens will be added to a liquidity pool on Uniswap, ensuring a fair distribution without any pre-sales.
* **Development Fund (10%):** 80 million tokens will be used for ongoing development and future upgrades of the Evire blockchain, distributed linearly over one year.
* **Ecosystem Growth (5%):** 40 million tokens allocated for project grants, bug bounties, and to attract stakeholders, also distributed linearly over one year.
* **Community and Marketing (10%):** 80 million tokens dedicated to community initiatives and marketing efforts, vested over one year.
* **Block Rewards (25%):** 200 million tokens will be minted as block rewards for validators and delegators, with a six-month cliff followed by a two-year linear release.
* **Reserves (5%):** 40 million tokens reserved for emergency situations, distributed linearly over one year.

### Circulating Supply and Controlled Funds

The circulating supply of EVIRE tokens excludes certain funds managed by the Evire team:

* **Ecosystem Growth Fund, u**sed for ecosystem development, project grants, and bug bounties.
* **Reserves Fund, a** last-resort fund to address unforeseen issues requiring additional funding.

These funds are not included in the circulating supply to prevent staking for passive income or influencing governance. They also ensure the network's bonding rate remains unaffected. Any use of these tokens by Evire must be moved to an intermediate account and accounted for in the network's circulating supply. On Ethereum, these funds are controlled by two multisig addresses:

1.
2.

### Block Rewards

A total of 25% of the tokens, equating to 200 million EVIRE tokens, will be distributed as block rewards to validators and delegators over the first 4 years of the mainnet. This incentivization ensures network security by encouraging validator participation and preventing fraudulent activities like double-spending. Validators also earn transaction fees (gas) from transaction creators, providing a sustainable incentive model. After five years, it is anticipated that transaction fees will be sufficient to reward validators without needing to mint additional block rewards.
