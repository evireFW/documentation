### The Journey of the Evire Team

The core team of Evire comprises four passionate blockchain developers who have known each other for many years. Our paths crossed while working on various projects across different domains like AI, gaming, RWA and DePIN. Over time, we have shared experiences, exchanged knowledge and supported each other whenever challenges arose.

Despite our work in distinct areas, we often encountered the same fundamental issues: a lack of integrated infrastructure and the constant need to reinvent basic components even though many open-source solutions were already available. There was no optimal framework that combined these elements seamlessly, which would allow us to build efficiently without starting from scratch every time.

This recurring problem sparked the idea of Evire - a blockchain designed to provide native support for these diverse types of dApps. We envisioned a platform that could cater to specific needs within AI, gaming, RWA and DePIN, offering a robust and unified foundation for developers like us.

In January, we embarked on this journey to bring Evire to life. Along the way, we faced numerous challenges, one of the most significant being funding. Given the long-term nature of development with multiple phases, securing financial support was crucial. Eventually, we devised a funding strategy that we detail [here](finances.md). Another critical decision was whether to make Evire open-source. We carefully weighed the potential advantages and drawbacks and we found a solution that balances openness and project integrity, which we discuss in detail [here](licensing.md).

Through perseverance and teamwork, we've overcome obstacles and are now closer than ever to realizing our vision of a revolutionary blockchain platform. The journey has been demanding, but our shared passion for innovation and commitment to solving real-world problems keeps us moving forward.

### Why We Are Anonymous

We have collectively decided to remain anonymous to emphasize the impact of our work rather than seeking individual recognition. This decision helps us avoid personal biases and external influences, ensuring that our focus stays firmly on delivering innovative solutions and robust systems for the benefit of the community.&#x20;

By prioritizing transparency in our actions and results, we foster an environment where the merit of our contributions speaks for itself, encouraging a collaborative spirit that values substance over identity.&#x20;

This anonymity also enhances our safety and aligns with the decentralized ethos of privacy and fairness, allowing us to steer clear of risks and uphold the highest standards of professional integrity.
