# ▪️ Licensing

At Evire, we are committed to fostering innovation and collaboration within the blockchain community. As part of this commitment, we are excited to offer our specialized frameworks and tools to other projects through a unique licensing model that we call the **Collaborative Improvement License (CIL)**.

### **What is the Collaborative Improvement License (CIL)?**

The CIL is a special license under which we provide our frameworks and tools for free to other projects. However, this license comes with a key condition: **any modifications or improvements made to our code must be communicated back to us.** This ensures that any enhancements benefit the entire Evire community, fostering a collaborative ecosystem where all participants can thrive.

### **Advantages of the CIL**

1. Projects can leverage our cutting-edge frameworks and tools without any cost, reducing the barriers to entry and accelerating development timelines.
2. By sharing improvements, we create a virtuous cycle of innovation where each project contributes to the overall advancement of the ecosystem.
3. Shared updates can include security patches and improvements, helping to maintain a robust and secure environment for all users.
4. Users of the CIL can benefit from the collective knowledge and support of the Evire community, gaining insights and assistance from other developers who are working on similar projects.

### **How the CIL Accelerates Development**

1. With access to our pre-built, domain-specific frameworks, developers can quickly implement complex functionalities without starting from scratch.
2. As projects enhance our tools, these improvements are made available to all, ensuring that everyone benefits from the latest advancements and optimizations.
3. Projects can focus their resources on building unique features and value propositions instead of spending time on foundational development.
4. Our frameworks include built-in compliance tools, making it easier for projects to adhere to regulatory requirements, saving time and reducing legal risks.

### **Implementation Details**

To adopt the CIL for your project, follow these simple steps:

1. Understand the terms and conditions of the CIL to ensure it aligns with your project's goals and requirements.
2. Contact us to register your project and obtain access to our frameworks and tools.
3. Utilize our tools to develop your project, making any necessary modifications to fit your needs.
4. Share any enhancements or modifications with the Evire team, ensuring these improvements can benefit the broader community.
5. Participate in our developer forums, attend workshops, and collaborate with other projects to maximize the benefits of the CIL.

By adopting the Collaborative Improvement License, you become a part of a dynamic, forward-thinking community dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what is possible with blockchain technology. Together, we can create a more innovative, secure, and efficient digital future.
