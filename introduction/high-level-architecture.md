# ▪️ High-Level Architecture

### **Core Blockchain Layer**

At the base, Evire operates on a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, optimized for high throughput and reduced energy consumption. This layer handles all blockchain-specific operations such as transaction processing, block creation and consensus.

### **Framework Layer**

Above the core blockchain layer, there are multiple specialized frameworks each dedicated to a particular domain. These frameworks provide the necessary libraries, APIs and smart contracts tailored to meet the needs of different applications like AI integration or asset tokenization.

### **Service Layer**

This layer includes services for analytics, monitoring and orchestration tools that support the operation and management of decentralized networks and applications running on the Evire blockchain.

### **Application Layer**

The topmost layer where actual dApps reside. Developers can build and deploy applications that utilize the underlying frameworks and services. This layer is also where user interfaces and client-side logic are implemented to interact with the blockchain.
