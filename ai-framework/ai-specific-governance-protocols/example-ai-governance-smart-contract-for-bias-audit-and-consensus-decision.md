# Example: AI Governance Smart Contract for Bias Audit and Consensus Decision

This Solidity smart contract example demonstrates how to implement AI-specific governance protocols within the Evire AI Framework. The contract includes mechanisms for managing bias audits and facilitating consensus-based decision-making for AI-driven actions. The purpose of this contract is to ensure transparency, fairness, and accountability in AI operations by embedding checks and balances directly into the blockchain.

The purpose of this example is to show how blockchain technology can be used to support and enforce governance protocols in AI applications. This includes ensuring that AI model decisions are audited for biases, transparent, and subject to community or stakeholder approval before being executed, particularly in sensitive or high-stakes scenarios. The example aims to illustrate how smart contracts can serve as an effective tool for implementing ethical guidelines and maintaining rigorous standards in AI deployment.

**Explanation:**

* **Events:** The contract includes events such as `BiasAuditRequested` and `DecisionProposed` to log activities and enhance transparency.
* **Validators:** Validators are predetermined addresses that have the authority to conduct audits, propose, and approve decisions, ensuring that all actions are overseen by trusted entities.
* **Bias Audits:** Functions like `requestBiasAudit` and `completeBiasAudit` manage the bias checking process. These functions ensure that AI models are audited for biases before being deployed or used in making decisions.
* **Decision Making:** The contract allows validators to propose and approve decisions based on the AI models' outputs. The `approveDecision` function ensures that decisions are only executed following consensus, aligning with ethical governance protocols.
