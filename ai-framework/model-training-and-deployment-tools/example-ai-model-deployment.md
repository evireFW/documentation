# Example: AI Model Deployment

This Solidity smart contract example demonstrates how to deploy and interact with an AI model trained off-chain, within the Evire blockchain environment. The contract includes functions to set and retrieve AI model outputs and integrates basic model versioning and management features. It assumes that the AI model performs computations off-chain and the results are then stored on-chain via this contract.

This example is designed to illustrate the integration and deployment phase of AI models in the Evire blockchain framework. It highlights how developers can manage AI model versions and outputs securely on the blockchain, providing a practical solution for maintaining the integrity and availability of AI-driven applications in a decentralized manner.

}
```

**Explanation of Key Components:**

* **Model Versioning:** The contract maintains a `latestVersion` to ensure that only outputs from the current or previous valid versions are stored and retrieved. This helps in managing the lifecycle of the AI model as it evolves.
* **Model Output Management:** Outputs for each model version are stored with unique identifiers, which can be used to retrieve specific results. This system supports scenarios where multiple outputs need to be managed distinctly, such as different predictions or computational results from the same AI model.
* **Security and Integrity:** The contract uses basic access control (e.g., checking model versions) to ensure that data integrity is maintained and only valid interactions are allowed.

This example serves as a foundational template for developers looking to integrate AI model management within their blockchain applications on Evire, highlighting the platform's capabilities to support advanced AI functionalities securely and efficiently.
